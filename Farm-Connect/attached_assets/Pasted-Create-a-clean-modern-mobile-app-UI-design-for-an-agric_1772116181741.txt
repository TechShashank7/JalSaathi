Create a clean, modern mobile app UI design for an agriculture-based smart irrigation assistant called “JalMitra”.  Target users: Small and medium-scale Indian farmers.  Design style: - Simple, clean, and minimal - Government-ready and trustworthy - Professional but friendly - Easy to use for non-technical users - Large readable fonts - Rounded cards and soft shadows - Modern UI similar to Agri-tech startup apps  Color palette: - Primary Green (#2E7D32) - Light Green accents (#A5D6A7) - Soft Background (#F4F8F4) - Alert Red (#D32F2F) - Warning Orange (#F57C00)  Create the following mobile screens:  1) Splash Screen: - App name: JalMitra - Tagline: “Smart Irrigation Decision Assistant” - Agriculture-themed icon (leaf or water droplet) - Green "Get Started" button  2) Input Screen (Irrigation Analysis Form): - Title: “Irrigation Analysis” - Dropdown: Select Crop (Wheat, Rice, Tomato, Potato) - Input Field: Soil Moisture (%) - Input Field: Temperature (°C) - Input Field: Days Since Last Irrigation - Large Green Button: “Analyze Now”  3) Processing Screen: - Centered message: “Analyzing Soil & Climate Conditions…” - Loading indicator animation - Soft background  4) Result Screen (High Irrigation Required scenario): - Status Card with colored top border (Red for High, Orange for Moderate, Green for No Irrigation) - Irrigation Status: “High Irrigation Required” - Suggested Water Quantity: “25 Liters per square meter” - Estimated Water Saved: “120 Liters” - Risk Alert Message: “High temperature detected. Soil drying rapidly.” - Button: “View Insights”  5) Sustainability Dashboard Screen: - Title: “Sustainability Insights” - Card 1: Weekly Water Saved (e.g., 450 Liters) - Card 2: Irrigation History Summary - Card 3: Soil Health Score (e.g., 82/100) - Clean data visualization elements (simple charts or progress bars)  Design should feel realistic and implementation-ready, as if it is a real startup product that could integrate with IoT soil sensors and weather APIs in the future.

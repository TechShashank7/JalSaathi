there should not be field to enter moisture(%) and temperature as these inputs are to be fetched automatically from the sensors deployed across the agricultural field. so when this irrigation analysis page opens up, it should just show a few second animation inside those input fields with a placeholder "Fetching live moisture" and "Fetching live temperature" as if its fetching the live info readings from the sensors. and then it should come up any reasonable value. also on the bottom of the screen just above the analyze now button, add a card saying "Suspicious about the fetched data?" and then show a "Run diagnostics" button. When this button is pressed, a container in the style of liquid glass theme with little but adequate transparency should popup with decent animation above this same irrigation analysis and it should have a cross button on the topmost right corner which will make this container vanish then. now talking about this container, it should have following things

Screen Title:
System Diagnostics

Subtitle:
Checking sensor reliability and data accuracy

Add the following diagnostic cards:

Soil Moisture Sensor Card
Status indicator icon (green circle if working)
Title: Soil Moisture Sensor
Status text: Working Normally
Signal Strength: 92%
Last Updated: 1 minutes ago
Atmospheric Temperature Sensor Card
Status indicator (yellow if fluctuation detected)
Title: Air Temperature Sensor
Status text: Minor Fluctuation Detected
Variation Range: ±2°C
Recommendation: Recalibration suggested
Data Connectivity Card
Status indicator (green)
Title: Data Connectivity
Status text: Connected
Latency: 120ms
Last Sync: Just Now
Overall System Health Summary Card
Large highlighted card at bottom
Title: Overall System Status
Status: Stable
System Reliability: 88%
Include a horizontal progress bar showing 88%
Add two buttons at the bottom:
Primary button (green): Recalibrate Sensors
Secondary outlined button: Switch to Manual Input
Make the status indicators color-coded:

Green for working
Yellow for warning
Red for fault
Add subtle iconography for sensors and connectivity.
Keep spacing balanced and UI minimal, not cluttered.
Ensure it visually matches the irrigation result screen style.

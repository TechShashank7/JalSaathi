Redesign the current "Sustainability Insights" page of the JalMitra smart irrigation app.

Goal:
Make this page focus on long-term environmental impact, sustainability trends, and responsible water usage — not daily irrigation decisions.

This page should feel like a sustainability analytics report, separate from the operational dashboard.

Design Style:
- Clean mobile-first layout
- Soft green and earthy tones
- Rounded cards with subtle shadows
- Calm, environmental feel
- Minimal text, metric-focused
- Data visualization elements preferred

Keep page title:

- Add small upward trend arrow
- Include simple mini line graph or bar visual

3) Environmental Impact Score

- Circular progress indicator
- Breakdown:
   - Water Conservation: Good
   - Soil Moisture Balance: Stable
   - Over-Irrigation Risk: Low

4) Soil Stability Trend Card

Avoid repeating daily irrigation results here.
Focus on long-term impact, trends, and environmental responsibility.
Use green for positive metrics.
Avoid red unless critical.
Keep spacing clean and modern.
Make it feel like a smart agri-tech sustainability monitoring system.

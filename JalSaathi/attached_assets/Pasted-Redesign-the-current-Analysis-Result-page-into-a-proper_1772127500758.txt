Redesign the current "Analysis Result" page into a proper "Farm Intelligence Dashboard" screen for the JalMitra smart irrigation app.

Goal:
Make it look like a real data-driven agricultural analytics dashboard, not just a result page.

Design Style:
- Clean mobile-first layout
- Modern agri-tech startup feel
- Soft green background theme
- Rounded cards with subtle shadows
- Clear data hierarchy
- Not cluttered

Change page title to:
Farm Intelligence Dashboard

Remove repetitive large alert card at top.
Instead, structure the page as follows:

1) Top Summary Status Card
- Title: Today's Irrigation Status
- Status: High Irrigation Required (with red/orange/green dynamic color)
- Short explanation: Soil moisture below optimal threshold
- Decision Confidence: 87%
- Small colored status badge

2) Weekly Water Savings Card (Highlight Card)
- Title: Weekly Water Saved
- Value: 450 Liters
- Subtext: 12% more efficient than last week
- Add simple horizontal bar or small chart style visual

3) Irrigation History Section
- Title: Irrigation History
- Show last 3 entries:
   - Feb 21 – Moderate Irrigation
   - Feb 23 – No Irrigation
   - Feb 25 – High Irrigation Required
- Use small status color dots beside each entry

4) Soil Health Score Card
- Title: Soil Health Score
- Circular progress indicator showing 82/100
- Subtext: Stable moisture balance maintained

5) Farm Efficiency Score Card
- Title: Farm Efficiency Rating
- Score: 87%
- Short description: Based on irrigation timing, water usage, and climate data
- Use a progress bar

6) Add Bottom Action Buttons
Primary Button: Run System Diagnostics
Secondary Button: Start New Analysis

Make sure:
- Data is clearly separated into cards
- Use green for positive metrics
- Orange for moderate
- Red only for critical alerts
- Spacing is consistent
- Text is readable for non-technical farmers

Avoid too much text.
Focus on metrics, trends, and insights.
Make it feel like a smart agriculture monitoring system.
